### Confusion with version numbers and tags can lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in managing your GitHub repository's releases. To address this issue, here are some steps you can take to ensure clarity and consistency:

## 1. Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

Adopt a semantic versioning scheme (SemVer) to assign meaningful version numbers. SemVer consists of three numbers separated by periods: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Each number represents a different level of change.
MAJOR version for backward-incompatible changes.
MINOR version for backward-compatible new features.
PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes.

## 2. Release Tags:

Use Git tags to mark specific commits as release points. Tags can indicate the version number associated with a release. For example, if you're using SemVer, you might tag a release commit with the version number, like v1.0.0.

## 3. Tag Descriptions:

Include descriptions or release notes in your tag annotations. Describe what changes or features are included in each release to provide context.

## 4. Consistent Tagging:

Establish a consistent tagging pattern. For example, you might choose to use the v prefix before the version number to make it clear that the tag represents a version.

## 5. Tagging on Release:

Create a tag whenever you make a release. This helps you track and organize releases effectively.

## 6. Repository Documentation:

Maintain clear documentation in your repository's README or other relevant documentation files. Explain how version numbers are assigned, how tags are used, and the meaning behind each level of the version.

## 7. Release Branch Naming:

If you use release branches, name them logically to match the version you intend to release. This can make it easier to associate branches with specific releases.

## 8. Communication:

Communicate changes, releases, and version updates to your team and stakeholders. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings.

## 9. Tag Management:

Regularly review and clean up old or unused tags. Having a cluttered list of tags can lead to further confusion.

## 10. Use GitHub's Release Feature:

GitHub provides a built-in "Releases" feature that allows you to create structured release notes, associate commits with releases, and upload assets. This can provide a clearer overview of each release.

## 11. Review Before Merging:

Before merging changes into your main/master branch, review the version number and confirm that it accurately reflects the changes being made.
