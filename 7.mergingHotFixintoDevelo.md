### When merging Hotfix branch into develop creates unexpected issues:

If there are any conflicts during the merge, resolve them as you would with any other merge, following the conflict resolution steps outlined earlier.

When you merge a hotfix branch into the main branch, Git will attempt to automatically combine the changes. However, if the same lines of code were modified in both branches, Git won't know which changes to keep. This is where conflicts arise.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle conflicts during the merge:

## 1. Start the Merge:
When you run the merge command (git merge hotfix/your-hotfix-branch), Git will pause the merge process if it encounters conflicts.

## 2. Conflict Indicators:
Open the files with conflicts, and you'll see sections marked with conflict indicators like this:
 <<<<<<< HEAD
// code from the main branch
=======
// code from the hotfix branch
>>>>>>> hotfix/your-hotfix-branch

## 3. Manually Resolve Conflicts:
Edit the conflicted sections in the file to manually choose which changes to keep. You can also modify the code to create a new, merged version that addresses both sets of changes

## 4. Remove Conflict Markers:
Remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>) once you've resolved the conflicts. Make sure your code is in a clean and functional state.

## 5. Stage Resolved Files:
After resolving conflicts in a file, stage the resolved changes using the git add command:
git add path/to/conflicted/file

## 6. Commit the Merge:
Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, commit the merged changes:
git commit

## 7. Push the Merge:
After resolving conflicts and committing, push the merged and resolved changes to the remote main branch:
git push origin main

## 8. Test the Merged Code:
After successfully resolving conflicts and pushing the changes, thoroughly test the merged code to ensure that the hotfix was applied correctly.
