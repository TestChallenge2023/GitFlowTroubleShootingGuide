### While merging a feature branch into develop, you encounter conflicts: 

Encountering conflicts while merging a feature branch into the develop branch is a common scenario in Git development. Conflicts occur when there are conflicting changes between the two branches that Git cannot automatically resolve. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle conflicts during the merge:

## 1. Pull Latest Changes: 

Before merging, ensure that your develop branch is up to date by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

## 2. 

Merge the Feature Branch: Assuming you are on the develop branch, now you can merge your feature branch into develop:

bash
Copy code
git merge feature/your-feature-branch

## 3. Conflict Detection: 

If Git detects conflicts between the two branches, it will pause the merge process and indicate which files have conflicts. When you open these files, you'll see sections surrounded by <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> markers. These sections show the conflicting changes from both branches.

## 4. Resolve Conflicts:

Manually edit the conflicted files. Inside each conflicted section, decide which changes to keep or modify, and delete the conflict markers.
Make sure to review the entire file for any additional conflicts that might not have been automatically marked.

## 5. Stage Conflicted Files: 

After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files using:

bash
Copy code
git add path/to/conflicted/file1 path/to/conflicted/file2

## 6. Commit the Merge: 
Commit the resolved changes to finalize the merge:

bash
Copy code
git commit
Make sure to provide a clear commit message that describes how you resolved the conflicts.

## 7. Push Changes:
Finally, push the merged and resolved changes to the remote develop branch:

bash
Copy code
git push origin develop

## 8. Review and Test:

After the merge, it's important to review the changes and test the integrated feature thoroughly on the develop branch to ensure that everything works as expected.
