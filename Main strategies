Main Branches:
Master/Main: Represents the stable, production-ready code. All code in this branch should be deployable.
Develop: Integration branch for ongoing development. Features and bug fixes are merged here for testing and integration.

Supporting Branches:
Feature Branches: Used to develop new features or enhancements. Created from develop and merged back into it when the feature is complete.
Release Branches: Created to prepare for a new release. Bug fixes and minor improvements are made here. Once ready, merged into both master/main and develop, and tagged with a version number.
Hotfix Branches: Address critical bugs in the production code. Created from master/main, fixed, and then merged into both master/main and develop.

WORKFLOW STEPS

-Feature Workflow:
Create a new feature branch from develop.
Work on the feature, committing changes to the feature branch.
Once the feature is complete, merge the feature branch back into develop.

-Release Workflow:
Create a new release branch from develop.
Perform final testing and bug fixing in the release branch.
Merge the release branch into both master/main and develop.
Tag the release on the master/main branch.

-Hotfix Workflow:
Create a new hotfix branch from master/main.
Fix the critical bug in the hotfix branch.
Merge the hotfix branch into both master/main and develop.
Tag the hotfix on both branches.

Versioning:
Versions are typically represented by tags on the master/main branch and the release branches. Semantic versioning (e.g., X.Y.Z) is commonly used.
