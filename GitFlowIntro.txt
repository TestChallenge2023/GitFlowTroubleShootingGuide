Git Flow is a branching model that provides a structured approach to managing branches and releases in a Git repository.

Git Flow is a branching strategy for managing and organizing the development workflow in Git repositories. It was developed by Vincent Driessen and provides a structured approach to branching and releasing code. Git Flow defines specific branch names and rules for different stages of development, making it easier to collaborate, maintain stability, and manage releases. The main branches in Git Flow are:

Master/Main Branch (master): This branch represents the production-ready code. It should only contain stable, fully tested code. Direct commits to this branch are typically made only during releases.

Development Branch (develop): This branch serves as the integration branch for ongoing development. Feature branches and bug fixes are merged into this branch for testing and integration. This branch should also remain relatively stable and tested.

In addition to these main branches, Git Flow defines various types of feature branches and release branches:

Feature Branches (feature/*): Feature branches are used for developing new features or enhancements. They are created off the development branch and are named with a feature-specific name (e.g., feature/new-login-page). Once the feature is complete, the branch is merged back into the development branch.

Release Branches (release/*): Release branches are created when preparing for a new release. They provide a controlled environment for final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates before releasing to production. Release branches are created off the development branch and are named after the upcoming release version (e.g., release/1.0). After testing, the release branch is merged into both the master/main and development branches.

Hotfix Branches (hotfix/*): Hotfix branches are used to quickly address critical issues in the production code. They are created off the master/main branch and are named with a descriptive name (e.g., hotfix/bug-fix). Once the hotfix is complete, it's merged into both the master/main and development branches.

The Git Flow workflow follows these basic steps:

Develop new features and bug fixes in feature branches.
Merge completed features and bug fixes into the development branch.
When preparing for a release, create a release branch.
Test, fix bugs, and update documentation in the release branch.
Merge the release branch into both the master/main and development branches.
If needed, create hotfix branches for critical issues in production.
Merge completed hotfixes into both the master/main and development branches.
